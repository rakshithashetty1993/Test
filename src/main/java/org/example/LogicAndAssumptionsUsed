* Assumption - Input is taken from console which removes the quotes from input.(In case input is read from file,
I would split every line based on ""\\",\\"" that is ",").
Input is the array of String containing information of a person.

Then I parse input to a list of <Person> object which has firstName, lastName, address and age of a person.

* Assumption - First name is in the 0th index, last name is in the first index. Age is in the last index.
Name will not be blank or null. Name will only be having alphabet values.
* Assumption - Age will not be null, blank, will not be lesser than 0, will not be a decimal number.
* Assumption - Everything from second to last index but one is address. Address is not case sensitive, cannot be null,
cannot be blank.
Address is normalised to <street address>space<apt number if any>space<city>space<state> format in upper case
and any dots, commas or trailing spaces are removed.

Then I create a map of <Address, CountofOccupantsInThatAddress> for every address from list of <Person> and print it.

Then I make a new List of Person with age > 18. This list is then sorted based on last name and then first name
using the comparator function. This is then printed in sorted order.

I have added unit tests in src/test/java folder in class - TestCases.java
